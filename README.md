# Contact-Manager

My 2nd year project is Contact Manager which is developed in C programing language. The main purpose of this project is to help users efficiently manage their contacts allowing them to add, edit, delete, and search for contact information easily .
This program helps you store and manage contact information , including serial number, category(Friend/PG/Salesman/Customer/Student etc), names, gender(m/f), age, address, phone numbers, and email id etc . With features like Add new contact, Delete contact, Editing, Search contact List of contact and Exit , it's a comprehensive tool for keeping your contacts organised.

ðŸ’  Search contact

All data is store in file handling for persistent storage. Stay organized and keep your contacts at your fingertips!.
I implemented basic functionalities using arrays to store the data and created a simple user interface. 

My main role was coding the features , functionalities, debugging and ensuring that the user experience was smooth. One challenge I faced was managing memory effectively, especially when dealing with dynamic data . I overcame this by carefully planning the data structure and using proper memory management techniques.

The outcome was a fully functional contact management system that allows users to handle their contacts efficiently . This project not only enhanced my programing skills in C but also taught me valuable lessons in software design and problem- solving
